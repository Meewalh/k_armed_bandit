# k-armed Bandit Problem
This is an implementation of the k-armed Bandit Problem and a respective solution using reinforcement learning.

The program can be started with different values which can be set in the main.py file. It then simulates a simple reinforcement learning agent and plots the agent's performance.

The entire implementation is similar as it is described in chapter 2 of the book 'Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction' by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.
